- added ```ResetSemaphore``` to ```async_tools```
- added ```ToolbarButton``` to ```widgets```
- added the ability to specify a file extension on ```el.datastore``` files and specialized files
- added the ability to change autosave behavior of ```el.datastore``` files and specialized files
- added the ability to access public  ```el.datastore.File``` attributes on specialized files
- generalized parameter passing of ```el.datastore.File``` and ```el.datastore.specialized_file```
- added ```el.widgets.value_box.ValueBox```
- added module ```el.datastore.savable```
- added module `el.nixos_ctk_font_fix`
- added support for connecting `el.terminal.TerminalController` to non-ttys. 
  - Interactivity (prompt, command handling) will now automatically be disabled when connecting stdin to a non-tty (e.g. when using .desktop files or cron jobs) instead of the application crashing.
- added module `el.tkml`: Tkinter wrappers to build UIs more easily using a declarative ish "markup language" using context managers
  - `el.tkml.adapters` contains adapter functions to integrate legacy tkinter widgets and variables
  - `el.tkml.pack` contains a pack wrapper 
  - `el.tkml.grid` contains contextual or layout-based grid wrappers to simplify developer experience
- added `el.timers.WDTimer.active` property
- added `el.observable.filters.throttle` and a new `StatefulFilter` API to implement it and similar time-based filters
- added `el.lifetime`: A system to manage Callback and observable lifetimes using a `LifetimeManager`:
  - This system currently works for `el.callback_manager.CallbackManager` and `el.observable.Observable`
  - With this change, `el.callback_manager.CallbackID` has been removed and is to be replaced with `el.lifetime.RegistrationID`
  - The system is extensible, other registries can be managed as well by implementing `el.lifetime.AbstractRegistry`
- `el.observable.filter.call_if_true()` now supports a `False` case
- added `MaybeObservable` type and the accompanying functions `maybe_observe` and `maybe_obs_value` to `el.observable`
- `el.observable.Observable.observe()` now has a flag to disable initial updates
- added module `el.widgets.ctkex`: A collection of CTk Widgets with extended functionality such as touchscreen mode. (Unlike other `el.widgets`, these are not new, specialized widgets, but just regular CTk widgets with some additional functionality)
  - option to selectively disable corner rounding on `CTkEntryEx` and `CTkButtonEx`
  - patched support for `background_corner_colors`, `round_height_to_even_numbers`, `round_width_to_even_numbers` arguments (from `CTkButton`) into `CTkEntryEx` 
- added `spinbox.SpinBox` to `el.widgets`
  - configurable increments and formatting
  - text input and button input possible
  - configurable text/icons on buttons
  - child-widgets exposed for further customization
  - observable
- added working implementation of `ComposedObservable` and the `compose` helper function to `el.observable`
- added bidirectional linking support to observables using the `link()` method
